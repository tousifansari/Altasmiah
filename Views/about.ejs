      <p>
        To date, Green Arc has converted nearly 3 million square feet of commercial, industrial, and academic space. Formed initially to address the sports lighting market (e.g., tennis courts, recreation, and athletic centers, fabric-over-frame structures) with lightweight, non-glare LED lighting, Green Arc has helped revolutionize industry standards in terms of performance, efficiency, and cost savings. In addition to the sports lighting market, Green Arc provides LED lighting solutions for multiple facility types, including office spaces, schools, restaurants, historic structures, manufacturing and warehouse buildings, parking lots and garages, theaters, auditoriums. With reductions in direct wattage consumption and substantial reductions in passive heat gain, Green Arc’s LED lighting solutions can reduce a facility’s energy usage by well over 80%. Green Arc products are available for sale independently or as turnkey installations. Utilizing its licensed electricians, Green Arc can deliver complete installations of its entire product line on a national basis.

    <h5><strong>ABOUT GREEN ARC’S PATENTED ECLIPSE™ LED LIGHTING</strong></h5>
    <p>
      Designed specifically for the demanding requirements of air dome/air-inflated structures, butler buildings with reflective ceilings, fabric-over-frame structures, and natatoriums, Eclipse™ is designed with innovative Controlled Light Delivery (CLD) technology™ to deliver brighter output, better light distribution, lower wattage, and run much cooler for enhanced longevity, making them ideal for use over all court and field surfaces. By generating 50,000 lumens (405w), 55,000 lumens (450w), or 60,000 lumens (495w), depending on lighting needs, direct energy usage can be reduced to 62%, 58%, or 54%, respectively. Eclipse™ LED lighting is the ideal solution for both amateur and professional sports facilities, in both direct and indirect lighting configurations. Eclipse™ also has sealed LED arrays, making them resistant to water and dust, which will provide years of consistent, trouble-free illumination. Eclipse™ fixtures are DLC listed, and qualify for utility rebates in participating jurisdictions.
